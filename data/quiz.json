    "question": "Which setting primarily controls motion blur in your photographs?",
    "options": ["ISO", "Aperture", "Shutter Speed", "White Balance"],
    "correct": "Shutter Speed",
    "explanation": "Shutter speed controls how long the camera's sensor is exposed to light. Faster shutter speeds (like 1/1000s) freeze motion, while slower speeds (like 1/30s) allow motion blur to occur.",

  {
    "question": "In low light conditions, which setting would you most likely increase to maintain proper exposure?",
    "options": ["ISO", "Aperture value (f-number)", "Shutter Speed", "Flash Power"],
    "correct": "ISO",
    "explanation": "ISO controls your camera's sensitivity to light. In low light, increasing ISO (e.g., from 100 to 1600) makes the sensor more sensitive to the available light, allowing for proper exposure.",

  {
    "question": "Which setting gives you a shallow depth of field (blurred background)?",
    "options": ["High ISO", "Wide aperture (low f-number)", "Fast shutter speed", "Narrow aperture (high f-number)"],
    "correct": "Wide aperture (low f-number)",
    "explanation": "A wide aperture (low f-number like f/1.8 or f/2.8) creates a shallow depth of field, keeping your subject in focus while blurring the background.",

    "question": "If you want to photograph a waterfall with silky, smooth water, which shutter speed would be most appropriate?",
    "options": ["1/1000s", "1/250s", "1/30s", "1s"],
    "correct": "1s",
    "explanation": "Longer shutter speeds (like 1 second) allow moving water to blur into a smooth, silky appearance. This technique requires a tripod to prevent camera shake.",

  {
    "question": "When shooting sports or fast action, which setting is most critical to adjust?",
    "options": ["ISO", "Aperture", "Shutter Speed", "White Balance"],
    "correct": "Shutter Speed",
    "explanation": "Fast shutter speeds (1/500s or faster) are essential for freezing action in sports photography. This prevents motion blur and keeps fast-moving subjects sharp.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is a potential drawback of using a very high ISO setting?",
    "options": ["Overexposure", "Digital noise", "Too much depth of field", "Motion blur"],
    "correct": "Digital noise",
    "explanation": "Higher ISO settings (like 1600, 3200, or above) make your image more susceptible to digital noise, which appears as grain or speckles that reduce image quality.",

  {
    "question": "For a landscape photo where you want everything in focus from foreground to background, which aperture setting would be best?",
    "options": ["f/2.8", "f/4", "f/8", "f/16"],
    "correct": "f/16",
    "explanation": "Narrower apertures (higher f-numbers like f/11 or f/16) create a deeper depth of field, keeping more of the scene in focusâ€”ideal for landscape photography.",
    "image": "aperture.jpg"
  },
  {
    "question": "For a portrait where you want to separate the subject from the background, which combination would work best?",
    "options": [
      "ISO 100, f/16, 1/60s", 
      "ISO 400, f/2.8, 1/250s", 
      "ISO 3200, f/11, 1/1000s", 
      "ISO 100, f/8, 1/15s"
    ],
    "correct": "ISO 400, f/2.8, 1/250s",
    "explanation": "For portraits with background separation, use a wide aperture (low f-number like f/2.8) to create shallow depth of field. The moderate ISO and fast enough shutter speed ensure a well-exposed, sharp subject.",
